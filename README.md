# Story Voice Studio - Live Preview

This is a lightweight Angular 19 preview project built for testing the login UI and home background.

To run locally (on laptop):
1. npm install
2. ng serve --open

Files:
- src/assets/logo.png (icon used on login/home)
- src/assets/home-bg.png (home background image you uploaded)

This project uses a mock login (no real authentication) â€” clicking Login navigates to /home.
